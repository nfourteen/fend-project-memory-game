# Memory Game Project

NOTE: not a working implementation.

Memory Game created using the [SAM pattern](http://sam.js.org/).

## How to Play

Start the game by choosing a card, then select another. If they match, they'll stay open. If they don't, they'll stay open for a short time and then close. Match all the cards to win.

## Some Pain Points

- Traded wiring bindings in MVC to managing boolean flags in the State and Model
- Can't figure out how to make view components truly modular, ex. integrate timer into game view
